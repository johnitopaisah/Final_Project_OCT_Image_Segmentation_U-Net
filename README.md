## **Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to develop a robust and efficient U-Net model for retinal segmentation in OCT images. The model is designed to identify key retinal features and assist in medical image analysis.  

### **Features:**
- Implementation of U-Net in PyTorch.  
- Custom loss function combining binary cross-entropy and Dice coefficient.  
- Automated evaluation of segmentation performance using metrics like Dice Coefficient and Intersection over Union (IoU).

## **Dataset**
This project uses a dataset of grayscale OCT images for training and testing. Each image is paired with its corresponding ground truth segmentation mask.  
- **Preprocessing**: Images are resized to 480 Ã— 960 pixels and normalized.  
- **Augmentation**: Data augmentation techniques, including flipping, rotation, and contrast adjustments, are applied to improve model robustness.

## **Model Architecture**
The model leverages the U-Net architecture, which is widely used for image segmentation tasks.  
### **Key Components**:
- **Encoder**: Extracts high-level features using convolutional and pooling layers.  
- **Bottleneck**: Captures the most critical features at the center of the network.  
- **Decoder**: Reconstructs the segmented output using transpose convolution and skip connections.
